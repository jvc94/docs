		<title>A jogosultságok hatása a fórum használatára</title>
		<para>phpBB3 uses permissions on a per-user or per-usergroup basis to allow or disallow users access to certain functions or features which software offers. These may include the ability to post in certain forums, having an avatar, or being able to communicate through private messages. All of the permissions can be set through the Administration Panel.</para>
		<para>Permissions can also be set allowing appointed members to perform special tasks or have special abilities on the bulletin board. Permissions allow the Administrator to define which moderation functions and in which forums certain users or groups of users are allowed to use. This allows for appointed users to become moderators on the bulletin board. The administrator can also give users access to certain sections of the Administration panel, keeping important settings or functions restricted and safe from malicious acts. For example, a select group of moderators could be allowed to modify a user's avatar or signature if said avatar or signature is not allowed under a paticular forum's rules. Without these abilities set, the moderator would need to notify an administrator in order to have the user's profile changed.</para>

		<title>Regisztrálás egy phpBB3-mas fórumra</title>
		<para>The basic procedure of registering an account on a phpBB3 board consists in the simplest case of only two steps: <orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>After following the "Register" link you should see the board rules. If you agree to these terms the registration process continues. If you don't agree you can't register your account</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Now you see a short form for entering your user information where you can specify your username, e-mail address, password, language and timezone.</para>
				</listitem>

			</orderedlist>
		</para>
		<para>As mentioned above, this is only the simplest case. The board can be configured to add some additional steps to the registration process. </para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>If you get a site where you have to select whether you were born before or after a specified date, the administrator has enabled this to comply with the U.S. <acronym>COOPA</acronym> act. If you are younger than 13 years, your account will stay inactive until it is approved by a parent or guardian. You will receive an e-mail where the next steps required for your account activation are described. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>If you see in the form where you can specify your username, password etc. a graphic with some wierd looking characters, then you see the so called <emphasis>Visual Confirmation</emphasis>. Simply enter these characters into the <guilabel>Confirmation code</guilabel> field and proceed with the registration. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Another option is the account activation. Here, the administrator can make it a requirement that you have to follow a link mailed to you after registering before your account is activated. In this case you will see a message similiar to this one: <blockquote>
						<para> Your account has been created. However, this forum requires account activation, an activation key has been sent to the e-mail address you provided. Please check your e-mail for further information </para>
					</blockquote>
				</para>
				<para>It is also possible that the administrator himself/herself has to activate the account. <blockquote>
						<para> Your account has been created. However, this forum requires account activation by the administrator. An e-mail has been sent to them and you will be informed when your account has been activated. </para>
					</blockquote> In this case please have some patience with the administrators to review your registration and activate your account. </para>

		<para>Posting is the primary purpose of bulletin boards. There are two main types of posts you can make: a topic or a reply. Selecting the <guilabel>New Topic</guilabel> button in a forum button will take you to the posting screen. After submitting your post, a new topic will appear in that forum with your post as the first displayed.

			<para>Just like in your e-mail client, all <glossterm>private messages</glossterm> are stored in folders. Working with folders is similar to working with forums in phpBB 3.0. The <guilabel>Inbox</guilabel> is your default incoming message folder. All messages you receive will appear in here.</para>
			<para><guilabel>Sent messages</guilabel> will appear in either the <guilabel>Outbox</guilabel> or the <guilabel>Sent messages</guilabel> folder. As long as the recipient(s) have not yet read the message, it will stay in the <guilabel>Outbox</guilabel>. As soon as someone reads the message it will be archived to the <guilabel>Sent messages</guilabel> folder. If the administrator allows it, you can edit messages after sending them as long as they are in the <guilabel>Outbox</guilabel> and the recipients have not yet read them.</para>
			<para>Each folder, including <guilabel>Sent messages</guilabel> and <guilabel>Outbox</guilabel>, can hold a board-defined amount of messages. This is a global setting that only a board administrator can change. An info text displays the current number of allowed messages and the current percentage of space your messages are using at the top of each folder. If no restriction is displayed, you are allowed unlimited messages in each folder.</para>
			<note>
				<para>Please note that the total amount of messages allowed is a per-folder setting. You can have multiple folders which each allow 50 messages for instance. If you have 3 folders, your actual global limit is 150 messages, but each folder can only contain up to 50 messages by itself. It is not possible to merge folders and have one with more messages than the limit.</para>

				<para>To add a new folder, enter the folder's name into the <guilabel>Add folder</guilabel> input box. If creation was successful, your new folder will appear at the bottom of the folder list. You can then use it like a normal message folder and move messages into it or set a filter (see the section on <link linkend="pm_filters">Private Message Filters</link> for more information about filters) to automatically do it for you.</para>

				<para>Messages inside folders can have colour markings. Please refer to the <guilabel>Message colours</guilabel> legend to see what each colour means. The exact type of colouring depends on the used theme. Coloured messages can have four different meanings:</para>
				<variablelist>

							<para>You can set a message as marked with the <guilabel>Mark as important</guilabel> option from the pull-down menu.</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>
					
					<varlistentry>
						<term>Replied to message</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>If you reply to a message, the message will be marked as this. This way, you can keep hold of which messages still need your attention and which messages you have already replied to.</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>
					
					<varlistentry>
						<term>Message from a friend</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>If the sender of a message is in your friends list (see the section on <link linkend="ucp_friends_foes">Friends &amp; Foes</link> for more information), this colour will highlight the message.</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>
					
					<varlistentry>
						<term>Message from a foe</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>If the sender of a message is one of your foes, this colour will highlight this.</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>
				</variablelist>
				
				<note>
					<para>Please note that a message can only have one label, and it will always be the last action you take. If you mark a message as <guilabel>important</guilabel> and reply to it afterwards, for instance, the <guilabel>replied to</guilabel> label will overwrite the <guilabel>important</guilabel> label.</para>
