		<title>How user permissions affect forum experience</title>
		<para>phpBB3 uses permissions on a per-user or per-usergroup basis to allow or disallow users access to certain functions or features which software offers. These may include the ability to post in certain forums, having an avatar, or being able to communicate through private messages. All of the permissions can be set through the Administration Panel.</para>
		<para>Permissions can also be set allowing appointed members to perform special tasks or have special abilities on the bulletin board. Permissions allow the Administrator to define which moderation functions and in which forums certain users or groups of users are allowed to use. This allows for appointed users to become moderators on the bulletin board. The administrator can also give users access to certain sections of the Administration panel, keeping important settings or functions restricted and safe from malicious acts. For example, a select group of moderators could be allowed to modify a user's avatar or signature if said avatar or signature is not allowed under a paticular forum's rules. Without these abilities set, the moderator would need to notify an administrator in order to have the user's profile changed.</para>

		<title>Registering on a phpBB3 board</title>
		<para>Registering an account on a phpBB3 board is typically a simple and straight forward procedure.</para>
		<figure id="user_registering_typical_page">
			<title>The Typical Registration Page</title>
			<mediaobject>

				</imageobject>
				<caption>
					<para>This is what you should expect to see on a typical registration page.</para>
				</caption>
			</mediaobject>
		</figure>
		<para>After clicking the <guilabel>Register</guilabel> link, the terms and conditions of registering will be displayed, which you must accept to proceed. Some websites will ask you to select whether you are under the age of thirteen in order to comply with <acronym>COPPA</acronym> (the United States' Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998; more details can be found at <ulink url="http://www.coppa.org">http://www.coppa.org</ulink>). If you are younger than thirteen years of age, your account will stay inactive until it is approved by a parent or guardian. You will receive an e-mail in which the next steps required for your account activation are outlined.</para>
		<para>Beyond accepting the terms and conditions, you need to fill out some important details such as selecting a username, entering your e-mail address and desired password. You can also select your timezone and language.</para>
		<para>If you see in the form where you can specify your username, password etc. a graphic with some odd-looking characters, then you are seeing the so-called <emphasis>Visual Confirmation</emphasis>. Many boards will have this, otherwise known as a  <acronym>CAPTCHA</acronym>, which is an image with distorted letters and numbers which you must then type into an adjacent box. The reason for this is to ensure that you are a legitimate user registering (as opposed to a spam robot performing an automated registration). Simply enter the characters you see into the <guilabel>Confirmation code</guilabel> field and proceed with the registration. If you cannot understand the code, refresh the page to get a new code.</para>
		<figure id="user_registering_captcha">

				</imageobject>
				<caption>
					<para>This is an example of a visual confirmation code you might see.</para>
				</caption>
			</mediaobject>
		</figure>
		<para>Another option available is the account activation. Here, the administrator can make it a requirement that you have to follow a link mailed to you after registering before your account is activated. In this case you will see a message similiar to this one: <blockquote><guilabel> Your account has been created. However, this forum requires account activation, an activation key has been sent to the e-mail address you provided. Please check your e-mail for further information </guilabel></blockquote> It is also possible that the administrator himself/herself has to activate the account.</para>
		<para>Some boards will have custom profile fields. If the administrator has elected to display custom profile fields on the registration screen, these will also appear. In some cases, these custom profile fields will also be required fields, meaning they must not be left blank.</para>
		<para>Once you have completed all of the fields on the registration page, clicking the <guilabel>Submit</guilabel> button will complete the process. If you wish to clear all fields, clicking the <guilabel>Reset</guilabel> button will do this for you. After clicking <guilabel>Submit</guilabel>, you will be advised of your next step. In most cases, you will be sent an e-mail to the address you specified with a link to finalise the registration. Other options also include being able to login immediately (i.e. there are no further actions for the registration process) or waiting until an administrator reviews your registration and accepts it, in which case you will be notified by e-mail.</para>

		<title>Orienting Yourself in the User Control Panel</title>
		<para>The User Control Panel (<glossterm>UCP</glossterm>) allows you to alter personal preferences, manage posts you are watching, send and receive private messages, and change the way information about you appears to other users. To view the UCP, click the 'User Control Panel' link that appears after logging in.</para>
		<para>The UCP is separated into seven tabs: Overview, Private Messages, Profile, Preferences, Friends and Foes, Attachments, and Groups. Within each tab are several sub pages, accessed by clicking the desired link on the left side of the UCP interface. Some of these areas may not be available depending on the permissions set for you by the administrator.</para>
		<para>Every page of the UCP displays your Friends List on the left side. To send a private message to a friend, click their user name.</para>
		<para>TODO: Note that Private messaging will be discussed in its own section</para>
		<section id="ucp_overview">
			<title>Overview</title>
			<para>The Overview displays a snapshot of information about your posting habits such as the date you joined the forum, your most active topic, and how many total posts you have submitted. Overview sub pages include Subscriptions, Bookmarks, and Drafts.</para>

		<para>TODO: How to write a new post and how to reply. Special items like attachments or polls are subsections. Don't forget to mention the "someone has replied before you replied" feature, the topic review, and so forth. Topic icons, smilies, post options, usage of HTML ... it would probably best to add a screenshot with arrows to the different sections.</para>
		<para>Posting is the primary purpose of bulletin boards. There are two main types of posts you can make: a topic or a reply. Selecting the <guilabel>New Topic</guilabel> button in a forum button will take you to the posting screen. After submitting your post, a new topic will appear in that forum with your post as the first displayed.

		<para>phpBB 3.0 allows its users to communicate privately by using Private Messages. To visit the Private Messages section, you either can click on the [X new messages] link on the left hand side below the forum header, or you can directly access it through the <link linkend="user_control_panel">User Control Panel.</link>.</para>

			<title>Message Folders</title>
			<para>Just like in your e-mail client, all <glossterm>private messages</glossterm> are stored in folders. Working with folders is similar to working with forums in phpBB 3.0. The <guilabel>Inbox</guilabel> is your default incoming message folder. All messages you receive will appear in here.</para>
			<para><guilabel>Sent messages</guilabel> will appear in either the <guilabel>Outbox</guilabel> or the <guilabel>Sent messages</guilabel> folder. As long as the recipient(s) have not yet read the message, it will stay in the <guilabel>Outbox</guilabel>. As soon as someone reads the message it will be archived to the <guilabel>Sent messages</guilabel> folder. If the administrator allows it, you can edit messages after sending them as long as they are in the <guilabel>Outbox</guilabel> and the recipients have not yet read them.</para>
			<para>Each folder, including <guilabel>Sent messages</guilabel> and <guilabel>Outbox</guilabel>, can hold a board-defined amount of messages. This is a global setting that only a board administrator can change. An info text displays the current number of allowed messages and the current percentage of space your messages are using at the top of each folder. If no restriction is displayed, you are allowed unlimited messages in each folder.</para>
			<note>
				<para>Please note that the total amount of messages allowed is a per-folder setting. You can have multiple folders which each allow 50 messages for instance. If you have 3 folders, your actual global limit is 150 messages, but each folder can only contain up to 50 messages by itself. It is not possible to merge folders and have one with more messages than the limit.</para>

				<title>Message Markers</title>
				
				<para>Messages inside folders can have colour markings. Please refer to the <guilabel>Message colours</guilabel> legend to see what each colour means. The exact type of colouring depends on the used theme. Coloured messages can have four different meanings:</para>
				<variablelist>

						<term>Marked message</term>
						<listitem>

					</varlistentry>
					
					<varlistentry>
						<term>Replied to message</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>If you reply to a message, the message will be marked as this. This way, you can keep hold of which messages still need your attention and which messages you have already replied to.</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>
					
					<varlistentry>
						<term>Message from a friend</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>If the sender of a message is in your friends list (see the section on <link linkend="ucp_friends_foes">Friends &amp; Foes</link> for more information), this colour will highlight the message.</para>
						</listitem>

				<note>
					<para>Please note that a message can only have one label, and it will always be the last action you take. If you mark a message as <guilabel>important</guilabel> and reply to it afterwards, for instance, the <guilabel>replied to</guilabel> label will overwrite the <guilabel>important</guilabel> label.</para>

				<term>Sort By Username</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>If you want to find all members whose usernames start with a certain letter, then you may select the letter from the list of letters shown at the top of the memberlist. For instance, clicking "A" will display all usernames beginning with the letter A, while clicking "B" will list all usernames beginning with B. Clicking the hash (#) will display a list of usernames that do not begin with one of the twenty-six letters: in other words, numbers and other characters.</para>

Upon clicking this for the first time, the lists will be sorted in ascending order (meaning that usernames would be listed A to Z and joined date would be listed earliest to most recent.) If you want to order the list in descending order, wait until the page has loaded in ascending order and click the column heading you wish to order by for a second time.</para>

				<term>Find a Member Search Tool</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>You can narrow down your search results using the <guilabel>Find a member</guilabel> search function. This feature allows you to find members by their username, ICQ number, AIM, YIM, MSN Messenger/Windows Live Messenger address, join date, last active date, number of posts, IP address, and usergroup membership(s). All dates should be entered in the format YYYY-MM-DD (such as 2004-02-28 to represent February 28, 2004). The asterix (*) can be used as a wildcard for partial matches, such as entering "Ar*" into the username field to find all usernames beginning with Ar. Press the <guilabel>Submit</guilabel> button to begin the search, or the <guilabel>Reset</guilabel> button if you wish to clear all fields and start the search again.</para>
