    <section id="quick_settings">
        <title>General settings</title>
        <para>TODO: Probably needs a better title. How to change the default forum settings, forum
            name or description, for instance. Does not need to have all settings explained in
            detail. We have the Admin Guide for that. It would be good to provide a link if there is
            anything that is discussed more detailed in the Admin Guide. </para>

    <section id="quick_forums">
        <title>Creating forums</title>
        <para>TODO: A short step by step explanation into how to create a new forum and categories.
            Probably not necessary to go into subforums at this point. They should be mentioned, but
            a link to the respective admin section for further information should be enough. </para>
    </section>
    <section id="quick_permissions">
        <title>Setting permissions</title>
        <para>TODO: This shouldn't be too detailed. Just go through the steps that are needed to set
            permissions for the default usergroups and members. It can contain a short paragraph
            about usergroups and how Olympus handles them, but there is no need to explain them in
            detail. </para>
