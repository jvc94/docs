		<para>In this section you will learn how to change some of the basic settings of your new board.</para>
		<para>Right after the installation you will be redirected to the so called "Administration Control Panel" (<acronym>ACP</acronym>). You can also access this panel by clicking the <guilabel>[Administration Control Panel]</guilabel> link at the bottom of your forum. In this interface you can change everything about your board.</para>
		<section id="img_quick_settings_boardsettings">
			<title>Board Settings</title>
			<para>The first section of the <acronym>ACP</acronym> you will probably want to visit right after the installation is "Board Settings". Here you can first of all change the name (<guilabel>Site name</guilabel>) and description (<guilabel>Site description</guilabel>) of your board.</para>

			<para>This form also holds the options for changing things like the timezone (<guilabel>System timezone</guilabel>) as well as the date format used to render dates/times (<guilabel>Date format</guilabel>).</para>
			<para>There you can also select a new style (after having installed it) for your board and enforce it on all members ignoring whatever style they've selected in their "User Control Panel". The style will also be used for all forums where you haven't specified a different one. For details on where to get new styles and how to install them, please read [insert link here].</para>
			<para>If you want to use your board for a non-English community, this form also lets you change the default language (<guilabel>Default Language</guilabel>) (which can be overridden by each user in their UCPs). By default phpBB3 only ships with the English language pack. So before using this field, you will have to download the language pack for the language you want to use and install it.

			<para>If you want to enable or disable some of the basic features of your board, this is the place to go. Here you can allow and disallow for example username changes (<guilabel>Allow Username changes</guilabel>) or the creation of attachments (<guilabel>Allow Attachments</guilabel>). You can even disable <acronym>BBCode</acronym> altogether (<guilabel>Allow BBCode</guilabel>).</para>

			<para>Disabling BBCode completely is a little bit to harsh for your taste but you don't want your users to abuse the signature field for tons of images? Simply set <guilabel>Allow use of IMG BBCode Tag in user signatures</guilabel> to "No". If you want to be a little bit more specific on what you want to allow and disallow in users' signatures, have a look at the "Signature Settings" form.</para>
			<para>The "Board Features" form offers you a great way to control the features in an all-or-nothing way. If you want to get into the details on each feature, there is for everything also a separated form which let's you specify everything from the maximum number of characters allowed in a post (<guilabel>Max characters per post</guilabel> in "Post Settings") to how large a user's avatar can be (<guilabel>Maximum Avatar Dimensions</guilabel> in "Avatar Settings").</para>

		<title>Setting permissions</title>
		<para>After you created your first forum, you have to decide who has access to it and what your users are allowed to do and what not. This is what Permissions are for. You can disallow guests to post or hand out moderating powers, for instance. Almost every aspect of user interaction with phpBB3 Olympus can be adjusted with permissions.</para>
		<para>There are two ways to assign permissions: You can set them manually or use predefined "Permission Roles" for a simpler but less powerful way. You can switch between both approaches any time you want, so there is no need to decide which way to go now. You can skip the manual permission introduction and <link linkend="quick_permissions_roles">jump directly into the section on "Permissions Roles"</link>, if you are eager to get everything running. But remember that "Permission Roles" do only offer a small crumb of what the "Permission System" has to offer and we believe that to be a good Olympus administrator, you have to fully grasp permissions. </para>
		<para>Both types only differ in the way you set them. They both share the same interface</para>
		<section id="quick_permissions_manual">
			<title>Manual permissions</title>
			<para>This is the most important aspect of permissions. You need to understand this to properly work with them. There are three different values that a permission can take:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para><guilabel>YES</guilabel> will allow a permission setting <emphasis>unless</emphasis> it is overwritten by a <guilabel>NO</guilabel>.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para><guilabel>UNSET</guilabel> will be seen as <guilabel>NO</guilabel>, <emphasis>unless</emphasis> it is overwritten by a <guilabel>YES</guilabel>.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para><guilabel>NO</guilabel> will never be allowed for a user. It <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> be overwritten by a <guilabel>YES</guilabel>.</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>The three values are important as it is possible for a user to have more than one permissions for the same setting through multiple groups. If the user is a member of the default "Registered Users" group and a custom group called "Senior Users" you created for your most dedicated members, both could have different permissions for seeing a forum. In this example you want to make a forum called "Good old times" only available to the "Senior Users" group, but don't want all "Registered Users" to see it. You will of course set the <guilabel>Can see forum</guilabel> permission to <guilabel>Yes</guilabel> for "Senior Users". But <emphasis>do not</emphasis> set the permission to <guilabel>No</guilabel> for "Registered Users". If you do this, "Senior Members" will not see the forum as the <guilabel>No</guilabel> overrides any <guilabel>Yes</guilabel> they have . Leave the setting at <guilabel>Unset</guilabel> instead. <guilabel>Unset</guilabel> is a weak <guilabel>No</guilabel> that a <guilabel>Yes</guilabel> can override.</para>

			<title>Permissions roles</title>
			<para>phpBB3 Olympus ships with a number of default permission roles, that give you a </para>
			<para>But permission roles are not only a quick and easy way to set permissions, they are also a powerful tool for experienced board administrators to manage permissions on bigger boards. You can create your own roles and edit existing ones. Roles are dynamic, so when you edit a role, all groups and users that have the role assigned will automatically be updated.</para>

		<section>
			<title>Setting permissions for your forums</title>
			<para> there are two permission categories:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Global Permissions</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Forum Based Permissions</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>To set the permissions for your new forum we need the Forum Based Permissions. First you have to decide how you want to set the permissions. If you want to set them for a single group or user, you should use the Group or User Forum Permissions. They will allow you to select a single group or user, and then select the forums you want to set the permissions on. But for this Quick Start Guide we will concentrate on the Forum Permissions. Instead of selecting a user or group, you select the forums you want to change first. The next screen lets you to set the permissions for multiple users or groups at once, which will make life easier when you need to manage a lot of groups. </para>

					</caption>
				</mediaobject>
			</figure>
			<para>The Forum Permissions screen shows you two columns, one for users and one for groups to select (see <xref linkend="img_quick_permissions_select" />). The top lists on both columns labelled as <guilabel>Manage Users / Groups</guilabel> show users and groups that already have permissions on at least one of your selected forums set. You can select them and change their permissions with the <guilabel>Set Permissions</guilabel> button, or delete them from the list. Deleting them will lead to them not having permissions set, and therefore not being able to see the forum or have any access to it (unless they have access to it through another group). The bottom boxes allow you to add new users or groups, that do not currently have permissions set on at least one of your selected forums.</para>
			<para>To set or change permissions for groups, select one or more groups either in the top or the bottom list (this works similar with users, but if you want to add new users, you have to type them in manually in the bottom text box or use the "Find a member" function). "Set Permissions" will take you to the permission interface. Each forum you selected is listed, with the groups or users to change the permissions for below them. </para>

		<title>Obtaining support</title>
		<para>The <ulink url="http://www.phpbb.com/about/">phpBB Team</ulink> provides many options for users to find support for their phpBB install. In addition to this very documentation, the <ulink url="http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewforum.php?f=1">support forum on www.phpbb.com</ulink> has many answers that users like you are searching for. Therefore, we highly recommend the use of the search feature before asking a new question. If you are unable to find an answer, feel free to post a new topic asking for help. Be sure to be descriptive when explaining your problem! The more we know about what is happening, the faster we can provide you with the answer you are looking for. Be sure to fill out the <ulink url="http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=128123">Support Request Template</ulink> with the information it asks for.</para>

		<para>In addition to the support forum on www.phpbb.com, we provide a <ulink url="http://www.phpbb.com/kb/">Knowledge Base</ulink> for users to read and submit articles on common answers to questions. Our community has taken a lot of time in writing these articles, so be sure to check them out.</para>

		<para>We provide realtime support in <ulink url="irc://irc.phpbb.com/phpbb">#phpBB</ulink> on the popular Open Source IRC network, <ulink url="http://www.freenode.net/">Freenode</ulink>. You can typically find someone from each of the teams in here, as well as fellow users who are more than happy to help you out. Be sure to read the <ulink url="http://www.phpbb.com/support/irc/">IRC rules</ulink> before joining the channel, as we have a few basic netiquette rules that we ask users to follow. At any given time, there can be as many as 60 users, if not more in the channel, so you are almost certain to find someone there to help you. However, it is important that you read and follow the IRC rules as people may not answer you. An example of this is that oftentimes users come in to the channel and ask if anybody is around and then end up leaving 30 seconds later before someone has the chance to answer. Instead, be sure to ask your question and wait. As the saying goes, "don't ask to ask, just ask!"</para>

		<para>English is not your native language? Not a problem! We also provide an <ulink url="http://www.phpbb.com/support/intl/">International Support page</ulink> with links to various websites that provide support in Espanol, Deutsch, Francais, and more.</para>
