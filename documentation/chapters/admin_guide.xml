		<title>The Administration Control Panel</title>
		<para>Even more so than its predecessor, phpBB 3.0 "Olympus" is highly configurable. You can tune, adjust, or turn off almost all features. To make this load of settings as accessible as possible, we redesigned the Administration Control Panel (ACP) completely. </para>
		<para>Click on the <guilabel>Administration Control Panel</guilabel> link on the bottom of the default forum style to visit the <acronym>ACP</acronym>.</para>
		<para>The <acronym>ACP</acronym> has seven different sections by default with each containing a number of subsections. We will discuss each section in this Admin Guide. </para>

		<title>General Configuration and Front Page</title>
		<para>The <guimenuitem>General</guimenuitem> section is the first screen you see each time you log into the <acronym>ACP</acronym>. It contains some basic statistics and information about your forum. It also has a subsection called <guimenuitem>Quick Access</guimenuitem>. It provides quick access to some of the admin pages that are frequently used, like <link linkend="acp_users">User Management</link> or <link linkend="acp_maintenance">Moderator Logs</link>. We will discuss its items later in their specific sections.</para>
		<para>We will concentrate on the other three subsections: <link linkend="acp_general_board">Board Configuration</link>, <link linkend="acp_general_client">Client Communication</link>, and <link linkend="acp_general_server">Server Configuration</link>.</para>

				<title>Board Settings</title>
				<para>The <guimenuitem>Board Settings</guimenuitem> allow you to change the most important setting of your forum installation: the name of your forum. Put the name of your site into the <guilabel>Site Name</guilabel> text field and it will be shown on the header of the default style and will be the prefix to the window title of your browser.</para>
				<para>The <guilabel>Site Description</guilabel> is the slogan or tag line of your forum. It will appear below the <guilabel>Site Name</guilabel> on the default style's header.</para>
				<para>If you need to close your whole forum to do maintenance work, for instance, you can do it by using the <guilabel>Disable Board</guilabel> switch. This will keep any members of your forum that are not Administrators or Moderators from accessing the board. They will either see a default message instead of the forum or you can add your own message in the text field below the check boxes. Administrators and Moderators will still be able to browse forums and use their specific control panels.</para>
				<para>You need to set the <guilabel>Default Language</guilabel> of your board. This is the language guests will see when they visit the board. You can allow users to choose other languages. By default there is only <guilabel>English [UK]</guilabel> installed but you can <ulink url="http://www.phpbb.com/languages">download more languages on the phpBB website</ulink>. Find out more about working with languages in the <link linkend="acp_system">Language Pack configuration</link>.</para>
				<para>TODO: Write about date format and timezone, may change, so leaving this out for now.</para>
				<para>The board will appear to your guests and members in the <guilabel>Default Style</guilabel>. In the standard phpBB installation two Styles are available (TODO: write more about them?). You can either allow users to select another Style than the default by selecting <guilabel>No</guilabel> in the <guilabel>Override User Style</guilabel> setting or disallow it. Please visit the <link linkend="acp_styles">Styles section</link> to find out how to add new Styles and where to find them.</para>
				<para>Moderators can send warnings to users that break the forum rules. The value of <guilabel>Warning Duration</guilabel> defines the number of days a warning is valid until it expires. Read more about warnings in the Moderator Control Panel. TODO: Add link to this section.</para>

				<title>Avatar Settings</title>
				<para>Avatars are generally small, unique images a user can associate with themselves. Depending on the style, they are usually displayed below the user name when viewing topics. Here you can determine how users can define their avatars.</para>
				<para>There are three different ways a user can add an avatar to their profile. The first way is through an avatar gallery you provide. Note that there is no avatar gallery available in a default phpBB installation. The <guilabel>Avatar Gallery Path</guilabel> is the path to the gallery images. The default path is <guilabel>images/avatars/gallery</guilabel>. The gallery folder does not exist in the default installation so you have to add it manually if you want to use it.</para>
				<para>The images you want to use for your gallery need to be in a folder inside the gallery path. Images directly in the gallery path won't be recognised. There is also no support for sub folders inside the gallery folder. </para>
				<para>The second approach to avatars is through <guilabel>Remote Avatars</guilabel>. This are simply images linked from another website. Your members can add a link to the image they want to use in their profile. To give you some control over the size of the avatars you can define the minimum and maximum size of the images. The disadvantage of <guilabel>Remote Avatars</guilabel> is that you are not able to control the file size.</para>
				<para>The third approach to avatars is through <guilabel>Avatar Uploading</guilabel>. Your members can upload an image form their local system which will be stored on your server. They will be uploaded into the <guilabel>Avatar Storage Path</guilabel> you can define. The default path is <guilabel>images/avatars/upload</guilabel> and does already exist after installation. You have to make sure that it is server writable (TODO: a link to a FAQ that explains this). The file format of the images has to be either gif, jpeg, or png, and the avatars will be automatically checked for their file and image size after the upload. You can adjust the <guilabel>Maximum Avatar File Size</guilabel> and images that are bigger than the allowed value will be discarded.</para>

				<title>Private Messaging</title>
				<para><glossterm>Private Messages</glossterm> are a way for registered members to communicate privately through your board without the need to fall back to e-mail or instant messaging. </para>
				<para>You can disable this feature with the <guilabel>Private Messaging</guilabel> setting. This will keep the feature turned off for the whole board. You can disable private messages for selected users or groups with <link linkend="acp_permissions">Permissions</link>. Please see the <link linkend="acp_permissions">Permissions section</link> for more information. </para>
				<para>Olympus allows users to create own personal folders to organise Private Messages. The <guilabel>Max Private Messages Per Box</guilabel> setting defines the number of message folders they can create. The default value is 4. You can disable the feature with setting value to 0. </para>
				<para><guilabel>Max Private Messages Per Box</guilabel> sets the number of Private Messages each folder can contain. The default value is <guilabel>50</guilabel>, Set it to 0 to allow unlimited messages per folder. </para>
				<para>If you limit the number of messages users can store in their folders, you need to define a default action that is taken once a folder is full. This can be changed in the "Full Folder Default Action" list. The oldest message gets deleted or the new message will be held back until the folder has place for it. Note that users will be able to choose this for themselves in their PM options and this setting only changes the default value they face. This will not override the action a user chosen. </para>
				<para>When sending a private message, it is still possible to edit the message until the recipient reads it. After a sent private message has been read, editing the message is no longer possible. To limit the time a message can be edited before the recipient reads it, you can set the <guilabel>Limit Editing Time</guilabel>. The default value is 0, which allows editing until the message is read. Note that you can disallow users or groups to edit Private Messages after sending through <link linkend="acp_permissions">Permissions</link>. If the permission to edit messages is denied, it will override this setting. </para>
				<para>The <guilabel>General Options</guilabel> allow you to further define the functionality of Private Messages on your board. 
					<itemizedlist>

			<title>Explanation of forum types</title>
			<para>In phpBB 3.0 there are three forum types. A forum can be a normal forum where people can post in, a category that contains forums, or it can be a simple link.</para>
			<variablelist>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Forum</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>In a forum people can post their topics.</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Link</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>The forum list displays a forum link like a normal forum. But instead of linking to a forum, you can point it  to a URL of your choice. It can display a hit counter, which shows how many times the link was clicked.</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Category</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>If you want to combine multiple forums or links for a specific topic, you can put them inside a category. The forums will appear below the category title, clearly separated from other categories. Users are not able to post inside categories.</para>

			<title>Sub-forums</title>
			<para>One of the many new features in phpBB 3.0 are <glossterm>sub-forums</glossterm>. Especially bulletin boards with a high number of forums will benefit from this. In the simple flat category and forum approach in phpBB 2.0, all forums and categories were listed on the forum index. In Olympus you can now put as many forums, links, or categories as you like inside other forums. (TODO: Diagram of a 2.0 / 3.0 comparison)</para>
			<para>If you have a forum about pets for instance, you are able to put sub-forums for cats, dogs, or guinea pigs inside it without making the parent "Pets" forum a category.  In this example, only the "Pets" forum will be listed on the index like a normal forum. Its sub-forums will appear as simple links below the forum description (unless you disabled this). (TODO: Screenshot) </para>
			<para>This system theoretically allows unlimited levels of sub-forums. You can put as many sub-forums inside sub-forums as you like, or at least make sense. However, please do not go overboard with this feature. On boards with five to ten forums or less, it is not a good idea to use sub-forums. Remember, the less forums you have, the more active your forum will appear. You can always add more forums later.</para>

			<title>BBCodes</title>
			
			<para><glossterm>BBCodes</glossterm> are a special way of formatting posts, similar to HTML. phpBB 3.0 allows you to create your own BBCodes very easily. On this page, you can see the custom BBCodes that currently exist.</para>
			<para>Adding a BBCode is very easy. If done right, allowing users to use your new BBCode may be safer than allowing them to use HTML code. To add a BBCode, click <guilabel>Add a new BBCode</guilabel> to begin. There are four main things to consider when adding a BBCode: how you want your users to use the BBCode, what HTML code the BBcode will actually use (the users will not see this), what short info message you want for the BBCode, and whether or not you want a button for the new BBCode to be displayed on the posting screen. Once you are done configuring all of the custom BBCode settings, click <guilabel>Submit</guilabel> to add your new BBCode.</para>
			<para>In the <guilabel>BBCode Usage</guilabel> form, you can define how you want your users to use the BBCode. Let's say you want to create a new font BBCode that will let your users pick a font to use for their text. An example of what to put under <guilabel>BBCode Usage</guilabel> would be
				<code>[font={FONTNAME}]{TEXT}[/font]</code>
				This would make a new [font] BBCode, and will allow the user to pick what font face they want for the text. The user's text is represented by <guilabel>TEXT</guilabel>,while <guilabel>FONTNAME</guilabel> represents whatever font name the user types in.
			</para>
			<para>In the <guilabel>HTML Replacement</guilabel>form, you can define what HTML code your new BBCode will use to actually format the text. In the case of making a new [font] BBCode, try
				<code>&lt;span style="font-family: {FONTNAME}"&gt;{TEXT}&lt;span&gt;</code>
				This HTML code will be used to actually format the user's text.
			</para>
			<para>The third option to consider when adding a custom BBCode is what sort of help message you want to display to your users if they choose to use the new BBCode. Ideally, the helpline message is a short note or tip for the user using the BBCode. This message will be displayed below the BBCode row on the posting screens.</para>
			<note>
				<para>If the next option described, <guilabel>Display on posting</guilabel>, isn't enabled, the helpline message will not be displayed.</para>
			</note>
			<para>Lastly, when adding a new BBCode, you can decide whether or not you want an actual BBCode button for your new BBCode to be displayed on the posting screens. If you want this, then check the <guilabel>Display on posting</guilabel> checkbox.</para>

				<listitem><para><guilabel>Full folder default action</guilabel>: Sometimes your users want to send each other a private message, but the intended recipient has a full folder. This setting will define exactly what will happen to the sent message. You can either set it so that an old message will be deleted to make room for the new message, or the new messages will be held back until the recipient makes room in his inbox. Note that the default action for the <guilabel>Sentbox</guilabel> is the deletion of old messages.</para></listitem>

			<para>To overcome this problem, you are able to assign each user exactly one "Default group". The user will only inherit the attributes of this group. Note, that it is not possible to mix attributes: If one group has a rank but no avatar, and another group has only a avatar, it is not possible to display the avatar from one group and the rank from the other group.

			<important><para>Default groups have no influence on permissions. There is no added permissions bonus for your default group, so a user's permissions will stay the same, no matter what group is his default one.</para></important>
			<para>You can change default groups in two ways. Either through the user management (see <xref linkend="acp_users"/>) <!-- TODO: LINK  TO MANAGE USERS /--> or directly through the groups management (<guilabel>Manage groups</guilabel>). Please be careful with the second option, as when you change the default group through a group directly, this will change the default group for <emphasis>all</emphasis> its group members and overwrite their old default groups. So, if you change the default group for the "Registered Users" group by using the <guilabel>Default</guilabel> link, all members of your forum will have this group as their default one, even members of the Administrators and Moderators groups as they are also members of "Registered Users".</para>
			<important><para>If you make a group the default one that has a rank and avatar set, the user's old avatar and rank will be overwritten by the group.</para></important>
