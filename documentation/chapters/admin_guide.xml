		<title>The Administration Control Panel</title>
		<para>Even more so than its predecessor, phpBB 3.0 "Olympus" is highly configurable. You can tune, adjust, or turn off almost all features. To make this load of settings as accessible as possible, we redesigned the Administration Control Panel (ACP) completely. </para>
		<para>Click on the <guilabel>Administration Control Panel</guilabel> link on the bottom of the default forum style to visit the <acronym>ACP</acronym>. TODO: Screenshot</para>
		<para>The <acronym>ACP</acronym> has seven different sections by default with each containing a number of subsections. We will discuss each section in this Admin Guide. </para>

		<title>General Configuration and Front Page</title>
		<para>The General section is the first screen you see each time you log into the Admin Control Panel. It contains some basic statistics and information about your forum. It also has a subsection called <guimenuitem>Quick Access</guimenuitem>. It provides a quick access to some of the more often visited admin pages like <link linkend="acp_users">User Management</link> or <link linkend="acp_maintenance">Moderator Logs</link>. We will discuss its items later in their specific sections.</para>
		<para>We will concentrate on the other three subsections: <link linkend="acp_general_board">Board Configuration</link>, <link linkend="acp_general_client">Client Communication</link>, and <link linkend="acp_general_server">Server Configuration</link>.</para>

				<title>Board Settings</title>
				<para>The <guimenuitem>Board Settings</guimenuitem> allow you to change the most important setting of your forum installation: the name of your forum. Put the name of your site into the <guilabel>Site Name</guilabel> text field and it will be shown on the header of the default style and will be the prefix to the window title of your browser.</para>
				<para>The <guilabel>Site Description</guilabel> is the slogan or tag line of your forum. It will appear below the <guilabel>Site Name</guilabel> on the default style's header.</para>
				<para>If you need to close your whole forum to do maintenance work, for instance, you can do it by using the <guilabel>Disable Board</guilabel> switch. This will keep any members of your forum that are not Administrators or Moderators from accessing the board. They will either see a default message instead of the forum or you can add your own message in the text field below the check boxes. Administrators and Moderators will still be able to browse forums and use their specific control panels.</para>
				<para>You need to set the <guilabel>Default Language</guilabel> of your board. This is the language guests will see when they visit the board. You can allow users to choose other languages. By default there is only <guilabel>English [UK]</guilabel> installed but you can <ulink url="http://www.phpbb.com/languages">download more languages on the phpBB website</ulink>. Find out more about working with languages in the <link linkend="acp_system">Language Pack configuration</link>.</para>
				<para>TODO: Write about date format and timezone, may change, so leaving this out for now.</para>
				<para>The board will appear to your guests and members in the <guilabel>Default Style</guilabel>. In the standard phpBB installation two Styles are available (TODO: write more about them?). You can either allow users to select another Style than the default by selecting <guilabel>No</guilabel> in the <guilabel>Override User Style</guilabel> setting or disallow it. Please visit the <link linkend="acp_styles">Styles section</link> to find out how to add new Styles and where to find them.</para>
				<para>Moderators can send warnings to users that break the forum rules. The value of <guilabel>Warning Duration</guilabel> defines the number of days a warning is valid until it expires. Read more about warnings in the Moderator Control Panel. TODO: Add link to this section.</para>

				<title>Avatar Settings</title>
				<para>Avatars are generally small, unique images a user can associate with themselves. Depending on the style they are usually displayed below the user name when viewing topics. Here you can determine how users can define their avatars.</para>
				<para>There are three different ways a user can add an avatar to their profile. The first way is through an avatar gallery you provide. Note that there is no avatar gallery available in a default phpBB installation. The <guilabel>Avatar Gallery Path</guilabel> is the path to the gallery images. The default path is <guilabel>images/avatars/gallery</guilabel>. The gallery folder does not exist in the default installation so you have to add it manually if you want to use it.</para>
				<para>The images you want to use for your gallery need to be in a folder inside the gallery path. Images directly in the gallery path won't be recognised. There is also no support for sub folders inside the gallery folder. </para>
				<para>The second approach to avatars is through <guilabel>Remote Avatars</guilabel>. This are simply images linked from another website. Your members can add a link to the image they want to use in their profile. To give you some control over the size of the avatars you can define the minimum and maximum size of the images. The disadvantage of <guilabel>Remote Avatars</guilabel> is that you are not able to control the file size.</para>
				<para>The third approach to avatars is through <guilabel>Avatar Uploading</guilabel>. Your members can upload an image form their local system which will be stored on your server. They will be uploaded into the <guilabel>Avatar Storage Path</guilabel> you can define. The default path is <guilabel>images/avatars/upload</guilabel> and does already exist after installation. You have to make sure that it is server writable (TODO: a link to a FAQ that explains this). The file format of the images has to be either gif, jpeg, or png, and the avatars will be automatically checked for their file and image size after the upload. You can adjust the <guilabel>Maximum Avatar File Size</guilabel> and images that are bigger than the allowed value will be discarded.</para>

				<title>Private Messaging</title>
				<para> Private Messages are a way for registered members to communicate privately through your board without the need to fall back to e-mail or instant messaging. </para>
				<para> You can disable this feature with the <guilabel>Private Messaging</guilabel> setting. This will keep the feature turned off for the whole board. You can disable Private Messages for selected users or groups with <link linkend="acp_permissions">Permissions</link>. Please see the <link linkend="acp_permissions">Permissions section</link> for more information. </para>
				<para> Olympus allows users to create own personal folders to organise Private Messages. The <guilabel>Max Private Messages Per Box</guilabel> setting defines the number of message folders they can create. The default value is 4. You can disable the feature with setting value to 0. </para>
				<para><guilabel>Max Private Messages Per Box</guilabel> sets the number of Private Messages each folder can contain. The default value is <guilabel>50</guilabel>, Set it to 0 to allow unlimited messages per folder. </para>
				<para> If you limit the number of messages users can store in their folders, you need to define a default action that is taken once a folder is full. This can be changed in the "Full Folder Default Action" list. The oldest message gets deleted or the new message will be held back until the folder has place for it. Note that users will be able to choose this for themselves in their PM options and this setting only changes the default value they face. This will not override the action a user chosen. </para>
				<para> When sending a Private Message it is still possible to edit the message until the recipient reads it. After it was read, editing the message is no longer possible. To limit the time a message can be edited before the recipient reads it, you can set the <guilabel>Limit Editing Time</guilabel>. The default value is 0 which allows editing until the message is read. Note that you can disallow users or groups to edit Private Messages after sending through <link linkend="acp_permissions">Permissions</link>. If the permission to edit messages is denied, it will override this setting. </para>
				<para>The <guilabel>General Options</guilabel> allow you to further define the functionality of Private Messages on your board. 
					<itemizedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para><guilabel>Allow Mass PMs:</guilabel> enables the sending of Private Messages to multiple recipients. This feature is enabled by default. Disabling it will also disallow sending of Private Messages to groups. </para>

						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>We don't allow attachments by default. Further settings for attachments in Private Messages are in the <link linkend="acp_board_attachments">Attachment Settings</link>. There you can define the number of attachments per message for instance.</para>

			<title>Explanation of forum types</title>

			<variablelist>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Forum</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>In a forum people can post their topics.</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Link</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>The forum list displays a forum link like a normal forum. But instead of linking to a forum, you can point it  to a URL of your choice. It can display a hit counter, which shows how many times the link was clicked.</para>

				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Category</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>If you want to combine multiple forums or links for a specific topic, you can put them inside a category. The forums will appear below the category title, clearly separated from other categories. Users are not able to post inside categories.</para>

			<title>Sub-forums</title>
			<para>One of the many new features in phpBB 3.0 are <glossterm>sub-forums</glossterm>. Especially bulletin boards with a high number of forums will benefit from this. In the simple flat category and forum approach in phpBB 2.0, all forums and categories were listed on the forum index. In Olympus you can now put as many forums, links, or categories as you like inside other forums. (TODO: Diagram of a 2.0 / 3.0 comparison)</para>
			<para>If you have a forum about pets for instance, you are able to put sub-forums for cats, dogs, or guinea pigs inside it without making the parent "Pets" forum a category.  In this example, only the "Pets" forum will be listed on the index like a normal forum. Its sub-forums will appear as simple links below the forum description (unless you disabled this). (TODO: Screenshot) </para>
			<para>This system theoretically allows unlimited levels of sub-forums. You can put as many sub-forums inside sub-forums as you like, or at least make sense. However, please do not go overboard with this feature. On boards with five to ten forums or less, it is not a good idea to use sub-forums. Remember, the less forums you have, the more active your forum will appear. You can always add more forums later.</para>
			<para>Read the <link linkend="acp_forums_manage">section on forum management</link> to find out how to create sub-forums.</para>

			<para>The initial <guilabel>Manage forums</guilabel> page shows you a list of your top level forums and categories. Note, that this is not analogue to the forum index, as categories are not expanded here. So if you want to reorder the forums inside a category, you have to open the category first.</para>

			<title>Manage Users</title>
			<para>Users are the basis of your forum. As a forum administrator, it is very important to be able to manage your users. Managing your users and their information and specific options is easy, and can be done via the <acronym>ACP</acronym>.</para>
				
			<para>To begin, log in and reach your <acronym>ACP</acronym>. Find and click on <guimenuitem>Users and Groups</guimenuitem>  to reach the necessary page. If you do not see <guimenuitem>User Administration</guimenuitem> , simply find and click on <guimenuitem>Manage Users</guimenuitem> in the navigation menu on the left side of the page.</para>
				
			<para>To continue and manage a user, you must know the username(s) that you want to manage. In the textbox for the <guilabel>"Find a member:"</guilabel> field, type in the username of the user whose information and settings you wish to manage. On the other hand, if you want to find a member, click on <guilabel>[ Find a Member ]</guilabel> (which is below the textbox) and follow all the steps appropriate to find and select a user. If you wiant to manage the information and settings for the Anonymous user (any visitor who is not logged in is set as the Anonymous user), check the checkbox labeled <guilabel>"Select Anonymous User"</guilabel>. Once you have selected a user, click <guilabel>Submit</guilabel>.</para>
				
			<para>There are many sections relating to a user's settings. The following are subsections that have more information on each form. Each form allows you to manage specific settings for the user you have selected. When you are done with editing the data on each form, click <guilabel>Submit</guilabel>  (located at the bottom of each form) to submit your changes.</para>

						<para>These are groups that are available by default in phpBB 3.0. You <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> delete them, as the board needs them for various features. You can still change their attributes (description, colour, rank, avatar, and so forth) and group leaders. Users that register to your board are automatically added to the predefined group "Registered Users", for instance. Do not try to remove them manually through the database, or your board will no longer function properly.

			<title>Default groups</title>
			<para>As it is now possible to assign attributes like colours or avatars to groups (see <xref linkend="acp_groups_edit" />, it can happen that a user is a member of two or more different groups that have different avatars or other attributes. So, which avatar will the user now inherit? </para>
			<para>To overcome this problem, you are able to assign each user exactly one "Default group". The user will only inherit the attributes of this group. Note, that it is not possible to mix attributes: If one group has a rank but no avatar, and another group has only a avatar, it is not possible to display the avatar from one group and the rank from the other group. You have to decide for one "Default group".</para>
			<important><para>Default groups have no influence on permissions. There is no added permissions bonus for your default group, so a user's permissions will stay the same, no matter what group is his default one.</para></important>
			<para>You can change default groups in two ways. Either through the user management (see <xref linkend="acp_users"/>) <!-- TODO: LINK  TO MANAGE USERS /--> or directly through the groups management (<guilabel>Manage groups</guilabel>). Please be careful with the second option, as when you change the default group through a group directly, this will change the default group for <emphasis>all</emphasis> its group members and overwrite their old default groups. So, if you change the default group for the "Registered Users" group by using the <guilabel>Default</guilabel> link, all members of your forum will have this group as their default one, even members of the Administrators and Moderators groups as they are also members of "Registered Users".</para>
			<important><para>If you make a group the default one that has a rank and avatar set, the user's old avatar and rank will be overwritten by the group.</para></important>
