    <title>Quick Start Guide</title>
    <abstract>
        <para>TODO: A quick guide through the first steps of setting up your very own phpBB 3.0
            forum.</para>

    <section id="quick_requirements">
        <title>Requirements</title>
        <para>TODO: An overview of the requirements.</para>

    <section id="quick_installing">
        <title>Installing</title>
        <para>TODO: Detailing the installation process step by step. Explanation of all items on the
            install pages.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="quick_settings">
        <title>General settings</title>
        <para>TODO: Probably needs a better title. How to change the default forum settings, forum
            name or description, for instance. Does not need to have all settings explained in
            detail. We have the Admin Guide for that. It would be good to provide a link if there is
            anything that is discussed more detailed in the Admin Guide. </para>
    </section>
    <section id="quick_forums">
        <title>Creating forums</title>
        <para>TODO: A short step by step explanation into how to create a new forum and categories.
            Probably not necessary to go into subforums at this point. They should be mentioned, but
            a link to the respective admin section for further information should be enough. </para>
    </section>
    <section id="quick_permissions">
        <title>Setting permissions</title>
        <para>TODO: This shouldn't be too detailed. Just go through the steps that are needed to set
            permissions for the default usergroups and members. It can contain a short paragraph
            about usergroups and how Olympus handles them, but there is no need to explain them in
            detail. </para>
    </section>
    <section id="quick_support">
        <title>Obtaining support</title>
        <para>TODO: Probably best if a support team member writes this section. Explain to the user,
            where and in which ways he is able to ask for support (support forums, #phpbb@freenode,
            link to international support site listing, and so forth), and make sure to suggest him
            to search before asking.</para>
